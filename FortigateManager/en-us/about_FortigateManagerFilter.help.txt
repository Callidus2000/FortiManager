SHORT DESCRIPTION
	Explains how to use the filter parameters of Get-FM* functions

LONG DESCRIPTION
	If you want to use a filter parameter you have to supply (an array of)
	strings in the following format:
	"{attribute} {operator} {value}"

	- The attribute depends on the object model you are querying.
	- the operator is one of the following:
	  -eq
	  -like   (use % (multi) and _ (single char) as a wildcard)
	  -contain
	  -ne
	  -notlike
	- The value is the value used for filtering

	Example:
	Get-FMAddress -Filter "name -eq srv123","name -like %.mydomain.com"
