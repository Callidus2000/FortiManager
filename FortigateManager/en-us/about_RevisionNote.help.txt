SHORT DESCRIPTION
	Explains how to use the RevisionNote parameters.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    The Web-GUI enforces the user to enter a "Change Note" which appears beside
    the revision entry. The "Change Note" can be used within the API eco system
    as the additional attribute "revision note", but it's not mandatory.
    Resulting from this it is completely possible to modify anything without the
    need to fill out this change Message. As a *breaking change* in
    version 2.0.0 such RevisionNote is a mandatory information for all API calls
    using one of this methods:
    set, add, update, delete, move, clone

    You can provide the data either for each function call like
    > $address|Update-FMAddress -RevisionNote "changed the color"
    or you can provide a default revision note while locking the ADOM:
    > Lock-FMAdom -RevisionNote "changed the color"

    This default note will be used until the ADOM is unlocked again. By
    providing this default message entry point most scripts prior v2 should be
    easy updatable.
